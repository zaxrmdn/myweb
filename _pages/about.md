Hi, I'm **Zakaria** or you can call me **Rama**, a System Administrator with a passion for automation, server management, and keeping systems running at peak performance.

With 3 years of experience working with Linux servers, virtualization, and monitoring tools, I specialize in building reliable infrastructure that just works. I believe in writing clean, repeatable scripts, documenting everything, and solving problems before users notice them.

### 🔧 What I work with:
- Operating Systems: Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS), Windows Server
- Automation Tools: Bash, Ansible, Python
- Monitoring: Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana 
- Virtualization: Proxmox, VMware, Docker
- Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, Route 53), DigitalOcean
- Networking: DNS, NGINX, Firewalls, VPN

### 🗂️ Why I built this site:
This website is my digital notebook — a place to share my projects, scripts, and blog posts about sysadmin life. Hopefully it helps someone out there (or future me at 3AM).

Feel free to check out my [projects](/projects), read my [blog](/blog), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/namamu) and [GitHub](https://github.com/namamu).

>Thanks for stopping by!
