A little story about my first post here, And I don't know how many times I've tried to use another platform, but it has failed.Actually, the problem is not with the platform but myself. I do enjoy trying new things and being curious, but that is also my biggest problem. Where because of looking for new things, things that were previously learned there are some gaps that are empty and need to be searched, fatally I ignore it.

And this is likely to be my last platform to try. Besides all that, I make this place a mediation for me to explore, this is important as evidence and my progress is all in this place. For future planning, hopefully I can consistently write several topics for the future, and thank you for those of you who have read this far.
